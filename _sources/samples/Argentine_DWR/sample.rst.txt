   Argentine Daily Weather report sample image - left-hand page. (Right hand pages are maps).

Daily Weather Reports are collections of telegraph observations used to make daily synoptic weathermaps. Argentina started producing them in 1902, and their series has the advantage of being printed. The Argentine DWRs are being `worked on through the Copernicus Data Rescue Service <http://brohan.org/station-data/sources/Argentine_DWR/index.html>`_, but the bulk of them are not yet digitised.
