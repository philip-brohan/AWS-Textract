   UK Daily Weather report from 1901 sample image - data page. (Other pages are maps).

Daily Weather Reports are collections of telegraph observations used to make daily synoptic weathermaps. The UK started producing them in 1860, and by 1901 they hasd established a standard format with a printed table structure filled in by hand. The UK DWRs `have been digitised for the period 1901-1910 through the weatherrescue.org project <http://brohan.org/transcription_methods_review/case_studies/DWR/DWR.html>`_, but other decades are not yet digitised.
