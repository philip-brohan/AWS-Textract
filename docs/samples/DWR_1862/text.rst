Sample from the UK Daily Weather Reports (1862)
===============================================

The `Daily Weather Reports <http://brohan.org/UK-digitisation/sources/DWR.html>`_ are collections of telegraph observations used to make daily synoptic weathermaps. The UK started producing them in 1860, and they started out as a simple printed table with handwritten entries.
