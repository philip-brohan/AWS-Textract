Sample from the UK 10-year rainfall sheets
==========================================

The 10-year rainfall sheets are lose-leaf forms, each recording monthly rainfall at a single UK station over a period of 10-years. The `collection of these in the UK Meteorological Archive <https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/SO_d383374a-91c3-4a7b-ba96-41b81cfb9d67/>`_ comprises about 65,000 such sheets covering 1677-1960 (though the early years include very few stations). These data were manually digitised in spring 2020 by the `Rainfall Rescue citizen science project <https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/rainfall-rescue>`_.
