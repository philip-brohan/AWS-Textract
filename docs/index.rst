Testing AWS Textract for weather data rescue
============================================

Our understanding of weather and climate depends fundamentally on observations, and access to weather observations covering a long period is a key requirement for research on climate variability and change. The world's archives preserve a wealth of weather observations, going back hundreds of years, but many are undigitised, and so unavailable for most use. There is `a substantial research community working to recover these observations <http://www.met-acre.net>`_ and we have run `several large data rescue projects <http://brohan.org/transcription_methods_review/>`_. All these projects use manual transcription of the archive documents, this works, but is much too slow: to rescue the millions of pages of of past weather observations in the archives we need to go *much* faster. 

`Amazon Textract <https://aws.amazon.com/textract/>`_ is a web service (currently in closed beta) that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. This document describes a test of this service as a tool for weather data rescue.
